	Summer 2020
* Developed software for an ESP2866 microcontroller using Arduino platform: the microcontroller collects data from a temperature sensor every 30 seconds, makes http GET and POST requests over WiFi, and controls the heating and air conditioning systems with a relay

* Utilized the MathWorks ThingSpeak IoT platform to collect and store temperature data, and to transmit system commands between the user and the microcontroller

* Designed and programmed an iOS app that allows the user to monitor and control the system from an iPhone. User can check the roomâ€™s temperature at any time, directly control the heating and A/C, and set timers for their operation
